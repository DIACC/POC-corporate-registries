#Prereq:

1. If you want to run the app on a local blockchain network (ie. not using Bluemix) you will need to have completed the Hyperledger Fabric [development setup](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/Setup/Network-setup.md).
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 0.12.0+ and npm v2+ is required if you want to run the app locally (npm comes with node.js)


# Corporate Registries Setup Options:
Decide if you want to use the deploy to Bluemix button. 
Using the button will bypass all the setup below, but you will not have much control over the application. 
This is great for just seeing what the app does, but you cannot easily play with the code. 

**Choose an option below:**

- **Option 1:**  [Button Instructions](./host_marbles_bluemix_button.md)
- **Option 2:** Follow these machine setup [instructions](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/learn-chaincode/blob/v2.0/docs/setup.md) to install **Git, Go** and **Node.js**.
	- When you have finished come back to this tutorial. Start the next section "Download Marbles" below.

### Download Marbles
We need to download marbles to your local system. 
Let’s do this with Git by cloning this repository. 
You will need to do this step even if you plan on hosting marbles in Bluemix.

- Open a command prompt/terminal and browse to your desired working directory
- Run the following command:

```
git clone http://gopkg.in/ibm-blockchain/marbles.v2
```

- This will clone the v2.0 branch to your local system. 

### Get a Network
<a name="getnetwork"></a> Now we need a blockchain network.

**Choose 1 option below:**

- **Option 1:** Create a Bluemix IBM Blockchain network - [instructions](./use_bluemix_hyperledger.md)
- **Option 2:** Use a locally hosted Hyperledger Network (such as one from docker-compose) - [instructions](./use_local_hyperledger.md)

### Host Marbles
<a name="hostmarbles"></a>Finally we need marbles running somewhere.

**Choose 1 option below:**

- **Option 1:** Host marbles on Bluemix - [instructions](./host_marbles_bluemix.md)
- **Option 2:** Host marbles locally - [instructions](./host_marbles_locally.md)

***


#<a name="use"></a>Use Marbles App
1. Open up your browser and browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or your Bluemix www route.
1. You should be staring at our Marbles Part 1 application
	- Part 2 can be found at [http://localhost:3000/p2](http://localhost:3000/p2), but lets stay on Part 1 for now  
1. Finally we can test the application. Click the "Create" link on the top navigation bar
1. Fill out all the fields, then click the "Create" button
1. It should have flipped you back to "Home" and you should see that a new marble has been created
	- If not click the "Home" tab again or refresh the page
1. Next let’s trade a marble.  Click and drag one marble from one person's list to another. It should temporary disappear and then auto reload the marbles in their new state. 
	- If not refresh the page
1. Congratulations you have a working marbles application :)!


#SDK / IBM Blockchain Deeper Dive
Before we examine how marbles works let’s examine what the SDK did to get our cc onto the network.
The options argument for `ibc.load(options)` contains many important things. 
An abbreviated version is below:

```js
	//note the marbles code will populates network.peers & network.users from VCAP Services (an env variable when running the app in Bluemix)
	var options = 	{
		network:{
			peers:   [{
				"api_host": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
				"api_port": "xxxxx",
				"api_url": "http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxxx"
				"id": "xxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_vpx",
			}],
			users:  [{
				"enrollId": "xxx",
				"enrollSecret": "xxxxxxxx"
			}]
		},
		chaincode:{
			zip_url: 'https://github.com/ibm-blockchain/marbles/archive/v2.0.zip', //http/https of a link to download zip
			unzip_dir: 'marbles-2.0/chaincode',                                    //name/path to folder that contains the chaincode you want to deploy (path relative to unzipped root)
			git_url: 'http://gopkg.in/ibm-blockchain/marbles.v2/chaincode',        //GO get https URL. should point to the desired chaincode repo AND directory
		}
	};
	ibc.load(options, cb);
```

This network has membership security; we can tell because there are enroll IDs/secrets in the `network.users` array. 
This means the peers will be expecting a validated `enrollId` on most API requests. 
Therefore, the first step is we need to use the /registrar API endpoint to register an `enrollId`. 
This creates a binding of sorts between the ID and the peer such that this `enrollId` cannot be used on any other peer. 
It's relatively safe to think of this step as registering an API key with a particular peer. 
The SDK does almost all the work here for us. 
It will first parse `network.peers[]` and `network.users[]` and run 1 POST /registrar HTTP request per peer. 
It will send the first `enrollId` to the first peer, and the second ID to the second peer and so on until every peer has 1 ID. 
The details of all rest calls are taken care of by the SDK but if you are curious we have [Swagger Documentation](https://obc-service-broker-prod.mybluemix.net/swagger) on the IBM Blockchain peer APIs. 
At the end of this step we are ready to deploy our chaincode. 

Before we deploy though, the SDK will download and parse the chaincode. 
This is when it builds up the dot notation we can use to ultimately call cc functions from JS. 
Once it’s done downloading/parsing it runs the deploy HTTP request. 
We should receive a hash in the response that is unique to this chaincode. 
This hash will be used along with the registered `enrollId` in all future invocations / queries against this cc. 


#Marbles Deeper Dive
Hopefully you have successfully traded a marble or two between users. 
Let’s look at how this was done by starting at the chaincode.

__set_user()__

```js
	type Marble struct{
		Name string `json:"name"`
		Color string `json:"color"`
		Size int `json:"size"`
		User string `json:"user"`
	}

	// ============================================================================================================================
	// Set User Permission on Marble
	// ============================================================================================================================
	func (t *SimpleChaincode) set_user(stub *shim.ChaincodeStub, args []string) ([]byte, error) {
		var err error
		
		//   0       1
		// "name", "bob"
		if len(args) < 2 {
			return nil, errors.New("Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 2")
		}
		
		fmt.Println("- start set user")
		fmt.Println(args[0] + " - " + args[1])
		marbleAsBytes, err := stub.GetState(args[0])
		if err != nil {
			return nil, errors.New("Failed to get thing")
		}
		res := Marble{}
		json.Unmarshal(marbleAsBytes, &res)       //un stringify it aka JSON.parse()
		res.User = args[1]                        //change the user
		
		jsonAsBytes, _ := json.Marshal(res)
		err = stub.PutState(args[0], jsonAsBytes) //rewrite the marble with id as key
		if err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		
		fmt.Println("- end set user")
		return nil, nil
	}
```

This `set_user()` function takes in an array of strings argument. 
Within the array the first index should have the name of the marble key/value pair. 
We retrieve the marble's struct with `stub.GetState(args[0])` and then unmarshal it into a Marble structure. 
From there we can index into the structure with `res.User` and overwrite the marble's owner with the new username.
Next we Marshal the structure back up so that we can use `stub.PutState()` to overwrite the marble with its new details. 

This is a `very` simplistic way to change ownership of an asset. 
The concept of an "owner" is simply the value of a string inside the marble's structure. 
We will explore more sophisticated methods in Marbles Part 3.


Let’s take 1 step up and look at how this chaincode was called from our node.js app. 

__/utils/ws_part1.js__

```js
	module.exports.process_msg = function(ws, data){
		if(data.v === 1){
			if(data.type == 'create'){
				console.log('its a create!');
				if(data.name && data.color && data.size && data.user){
					chaincode.invoke.init_marble([data.name, data.color, data.size, data.user], cb_invoked);
				}
			}
			else if(data.type == 'get'){
				console.log('get marbles msg');
				chaincode.query.read(['_marbleindex'], cb_got_index);
			}
			else if(data.type == 'transfer'){
				console.log('transfering msg');
				if(data.name && data.user){
					chaincode.invoke.set_user([data.name, data.user]);
				}
			}
		...
```

The `chaincode.invoke.set_user([data.name, data.user]);` line is where we submit our request to run the chaincode function. 
It is passing to our GoLang `set_user` function an array of strings argument containing the name of the marble and the name of its new owner. 
By "passing" I mean it is really sending a HTTP POST `/chaincode` invoke request to one of the peers in our network. 
This peer will in turn call the chaincode and actually pass the argument to the cc function. 
The details of which peer and the exact rest call are taken care of in our ibc-js SDK. 
For your own curiosity, the details of the Invoke API call can be found [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/API/CoreAPI.md#chaincode)
This code itself was called in response to a websocket message that originated on our user's browser.

Pretty simple, now let’s look 1 more step up to how we sent this websocket message.

__/public/js/part1.js__

```js
	$("#user2wrap").droppable({drop:
		function( event, ui ) {
			var user = $(ui.draggable).attr('user');
			if(user.toLowerCase() != bag.setup.USER2){
				$(ui.draggable).addClass("invalid");		//make the marble transparent to reflect a pending action
				transfer($(ui.draggable).attr('id'), bag.setup.USER2);
			}
		}
	});

	...

	function transfer(marbleName, user){
		if(marbleName){
			console.log('transfering', marbleName);
			var obj = 	{
							type: "transfer",
							name: marbleName,
							user: user,
							v: 1
						};
			ws.send(JSON.stringify(obj));
			showHomePanel();
		}
	}
```

We used jQuery and jQuery-UI to implement the drag and drop functionality. 
With these tools, we get a droppable event trigger. 
In the above code, we have attached it to #user2wrap and #user1wrap div elements. 
When the event fires we first check to see if this marble actually moved owners, or if it was just picked up and dropped back down. 
If its owner has changed we go off to the `transfer()` function.
This function creates a JSON message with all the needed data and uses our websocket to send it with `ws.send()`.

__Monitor-Blockheight__

Our Node.js SDK has a handy function called. `monitor_blockheight(cb)`. 
To use it we just pass it what function we want to be called whenever the SDK notices a new block has been written to the network. 
The plan is to use this event as a trigger to redraw the marble states. 

The Plan:

1. User trades a marble
1. At some point that event will be written to a block
1. The SDK detects a new block has been written
1. Let’s assume this new block contains our user's trade action, therefore let’s read all marble states
1. Broadcast the marble states to any connected websockets
1. Clients (aka browsers) receive the new marble states and redraw them

__./app.js__ (abbreviated)

```js
	// ========================================================
	// Monitor the height of the blockchain
	// ========================================================
	ibc.monitor_blockheight(function(chain_stats){
		if(chain_stats && chain_stats.height){
			console.log('hey new block, lets refresh and broadcast to all');
			ibc.block_stats(chain_stats.height - 1, cb_blockstats);
			wss.broadcast({msg: 'reset'});
			chaincode.query.read(['_marbleindex'], cb_got_index);
			chaincode.query.read(['_opentrades'], cb_got_trades);
		}
		
		//got the block's stats, lets send the statistics
		function cb_blockstats(e, stats){
			if(e != null) console.log('error:', e);
			else {
				if(chain_stats.height) stats.height = chain_stats.height - 1;
				wss.broadcast({msg: 'chainstats', e: e, chainstats: chain_stats, blockstats: stats});
			}
		}
		
		//got the marble index, lets get each marble
		function cb_got_index(e, index){
			if(e != null) console.log('error:', e);
			else{
				try{
					var json = JSON.parse(index);
					for(var i in json){
						console.log('!', i, json[i]);
						chaincode.query.read([json[i]], cb_got_marble);
					}
				}
				catch(e){
					console.log('marbles index msg error:', e);
				}
			}
		}
		
		//call back for getting a marble, lets send a message
		function cb_got_marble(e, marble){
			if(e != null) console.log('error:', e);
			else {
				try{
					wss.broadcast({msg: 'marbles', marble: JSON.parse(marble)});
				}
				catch(e){
					console.log('marble msg error', e);
				}
			}
		}
		...
	}
```

So this code is using the SDK's function `monitor_blockheight()`. 
It’s a straight forward function in that its only argument is a callback function you want called when the SDK notices a new block. 
Our code then goes off and starts 4 things.

1. It fires off a request to the peer to read the block's stats
1. It sends a reset UI message to all clients through the websocket
1. It fires off a request to the cc to read marble index and then reads each marble
1. It fires off a request to the cc to read the open trades (used in Part 2)

The results will then be sent to the clients via the websocket (in individual messages). 
One more small note is about this line `stats.height = chain_stats.height - 1;`. 
We subtract 1 because the API `/chain` tells me the number of blocks.
But the API `/chain/blocks/<block #>` takes the id of a block which is indexed to 0.
So, if we want details on blockheight #5, we build a request for `/chain/blocks/4`.


That’s it! Hope you had fun trading some marbles in part 1. 
Next up is [Marbles Part 2](./tutorial_part2.md). 
Part 2 adds some new chaincode functions making it a little niftier.
